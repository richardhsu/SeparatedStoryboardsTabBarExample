# Separated Storyboards Tab Bar Controller Example

The following project is an XCode project showing the use of the `TabBarController` and separated storyboards.
This allows for more modular coding that is helpful in group development as well as loading the files.
This is a simple project which I hope can help those learning iOS programming gain some insight when
building more complicated projects.

You can find my tutorial with this project [here][tutorial]. Understand that this is for those
just learning as I made this while I was working on a project that got too big and needed to separate things
out into multiple storyboards.
